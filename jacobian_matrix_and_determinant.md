#Jacobian Matrix

#### When you change coordinate systems, you stretch and warp your function. A Jacobian keeps track of the stretching.

The Jacobian can also be thought of as describing the amount of "stretching", "rotating" or "transforming" that a transformation imposes locally. For example, if (x′, y′) = f(x, y) is used to transform an image, the Jacobian Jf(x, y), describes how the image in the neighborhood of (x, y) is transformed.

#####A nonlinear map f : R2 → R2 sends a small square to a distorted parallelepiped close to the image of the square under the best linear approximation of f near the point.

Transforming an equation from polar coordinate system to the Cartesian coordinate system.
