# Fourier Series

In mathematics, a Fourier series is a way to represent a (wave-like) function as the sum of simple sine waves. It decomposes any periodic function or periodic signal into the sum of a (possibly infinite) set of simple oscillating functions, namely sines and cosines (or, equivalently, complex exponentials)
