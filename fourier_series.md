# Fourier Series

In mathematics, a Fourier series is a way to represent a (wave-like) function as the sum of simple sine waves. It decomposes any periodic function or periodic signal into the sum of a (possibly infinite) set of simple oscillating functions, namely sines and cosines (or, equivalently, complex exponentials). 

Fourier introduced the series for the purpose of solving the heat equation in a metal plate

Function s(x) (in red) is a sum of six sine functions of different amplitudes and harmonically related frequencies. Their summation is called a Fourier series. The Fourier transform, S(f) (in blue), which depicts amplitude vs frequency, reveals the 6 frequencies and their amplitudes
